We just published our local git repo
to remote GitHub.com reposstory
Few thing happened:
1. It automatically created new remote repo
under your account


how our work will continue locally

!. add a new file called note.txt
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commits to remote repository using push origin buttom
4. Observe it has been added in your  repository under GitHub.com

How to save after adding some text in sublime
control+S
Or click on File ---> Save

We do not have to push one comit at a time
You can push multiply commits in one shot
There is no limits
